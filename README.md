Fun as always but in my media query - max-width: 1440px did not work. When I set it to max-width: 1440px it seemed to override it and set the max-width to just 794px. I don't know why or how to fix it. I have always used max-width before in my media queries and it has always worked.

I tried using grid-template-areas for the 8 images but it gave me trouble so instead I set grid-template-columns with repeat(auto-fill, minmax(250px, 1fr)) and that worked beautifully.

Achieving the white lines under the links during hover state meant I had to do some research and trial and error but it was great to learn.
